Covid on the Cloud is a project developed by Oumayma Amiri as part of cloud semester project at the University of Eurecom.

### Run the app locally

To make the app run locally, you will need to follow the following steps:

Clone the git repository. Then, move to frontend branch and install its dependencies. Once the installation is done, you are off to go! Run the app.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/oumari/covid-19.git
$ git checkout frontend
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```
Now lets turn on the backend. In another directory of your choice we will clone the git repository, install the dependencies and run the app.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/oumari/covid-19.git
$ git checkout backend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Reach your local running app on: http://localhost:4200/
